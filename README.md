# Flight Delay Calculator

This project provides a user-friendly interface allows users to interact with my other project [Flight Delay Calculator API](https://github.com/Gawrych/FlightDelay), which calculates the probability of flight delay based on factors such as historical airport statistics, weather conditions, and current traffic levels at European airports.

## How to use

To check the likelihood of flight delay, simply visit my web application [DelayFlight.pl](https://www.delayflight.pl) and enter the airport, date, and time of your flight. The application will calculate the probability of delay and provide a detailed summary of the contributing factors. This empowers you to make more informed decisions when planning your travel.

Additionally, my website allows you to check the weather conditions for your chosen airport for the upcoming five days. This information can help you assess whether the conditions are favorable for planning a flight during that time.
